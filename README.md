## Portfolio

Design enthusiast with strong observation skills who believes in designing spaces through an understanding of humans use of space.  

“Thousand of experiences teach us, that space communicates” - E.T.Hall.  

Having researched in Urban Interiors I strongly believe ithere is no boundary between space design and virtual design. When merged it can create futuristic spaces. Through Interactive media design, I would like to explore various ways of making user friendly designs from user’s perspective.
